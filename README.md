# LAN Cybersecurity Assessment

**Independent home network security audit demonstrating practical skills in vulnerability identification, network scanning, and mitigation strategies.**

## Objective
Assess the security of a home LAN network, identify potential vulnerabilities, and implement improvements to strengthen overall network security.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Network Scanning & Analysis:** Nmap, ARP, ICMP, TCP/UDP scanning  
- **Device & IP Verification:** DHCP analysis, AbuseIPDB, MAC OUI lookup  
- **Scripting & Automation:** Bash scripting  
- **Network Security Enhancements:** Router administration, VPN setup, OS updates, hashing for integrity verification, VLAN segmentation

## Methodology
- Conducted comprehensive network scans to identify open ports, active devices, and running services  
- Verified device legitimacy and IP reputation using ARP/DHCP tables and AbuseIPDB  
- Tested TCP connections for proper functionality and security  
- Documented vulnerabilities and recommended mitigations  
- Applied security improvements, including port hardening, VPN deployment, encrypted internal/remote communications, and guest network segmentation via VLAN

## Key Improvements & Results
- Exposed WAN ports blocked while LAN ports verified safe  
- Router admin interface secured with HTTPS; VPN implemented to encrypt internal and remote traffic  
- TCP connections verified for stability and security  
- Devices and router updated to latest firmware/OS versions  
- Critical files hashed for future integrity verification  
- Guest devices segmented into a separate VLAN (**Virtual Local Area Network**) to isolate visitors from the main network
